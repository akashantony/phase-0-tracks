What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

The Linux OS philosophy is treat all users with respect. 
The Linux OS can be worked on from the terminal and it is very similar to that of 
mac OS. 
It's not complicated but at the same time it does not have a guided mistake
prevention model. it gives the user the freedom to make mistakes which also give the
user the capacity and ability to make cleaver things as well.

VPS - Benefits.

A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is identical in function to a dedicated physical 
server. An operating system is installed to the VPS, and users have full access to 
control the system and install/run software. VPS’s suffer slightly in performance 
compared to a physical server, depending on the user’s needs, but are less 
expensive. VPS’s, due to their software nature, are also much more easily setup and 
configured.

Due to software nature, can be very easily setup and deployed compared to a physical 
server
Much cheaper to operate compared to a physical server (low monthly fee, no initial 
cost to purchase server)
Can be created and removed as necessary
Access to Off-Site Locations: a VPS can be hosted nearly anywhere, and in places 
that provide much better bandwidth and speed then a business’ physical location may 
allow.

 
Working on new files is a lot safer and it is considered a good practice because working on the root file risks exposing the root privileges and if anything happens to the root privileges then the whole system is as good as compromised.
